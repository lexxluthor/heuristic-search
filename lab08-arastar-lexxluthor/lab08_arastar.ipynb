    "In this lab, we will implement one of the seminal <i>anytime</i> heuristic search algorithms â€“ ARA*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind an anytime algorithm is \"to provide the best possible solution, given a limited computational (time) budget\". In our case, we will start by finding a bounded suboptimal solution with a high suboptimality bound and then gradually decrease the bound and resume the search. The crux of the algorithm is that it does not restart the search from scratch but rather reuses the previously built search tree to (significantly) save search effort. As we will see, a \"smart\" reuse of the search tree notably outperforms the straightforward approach where one straightforwardly invokes one WA* search after another from scratch, while decreasing the suboptimality bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "For details on ARA*, please refer to the <a href=https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2003/file/ee8fe9093fbbb687bef15a38facc44d2-Paper.pdf>original paper by Likhachev et al.</a>\n",
