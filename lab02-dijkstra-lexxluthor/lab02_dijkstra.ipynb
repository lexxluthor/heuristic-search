    "In this lab, we will consider the problem of finding the shortest path on a graph with a special structure, widely used in robotics and computer games — a grid. The grid consists of both free and blocked cells, and an agent can move from one free cell to another. The connectivity of the grid may vary; for example, a grid might be 4-connected when only cardinal moves (N, E, W, S) are allowed, or 8-connected when diagonal moves are allowed as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this lab, we assume that the grid is 4-connected**, meaning that only moves into the cardinal directions (N, E, W, S) are allowed. The cost of each move between two neighboring cells, represented as $v$ and $v'$, is uniform, with $cost(v, v') = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will explore the seminal `Dijkstra` algorithm for finding the shortest path on a grid. However, our focus is on implementing this algorithm as a \"heuristic search without heuristic,\" utilizing the distinct `SearchNode` structure, along with concepts like `Open` and `Closed`.\n",

    "*The more advanced algorithms we will be discussing in the next labs will build upon much of this implementation. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that your code is both correct and efficient.*\n",

    "When you finish implementing search algorithms, you'll naturally want to test them. The following functions will help you in doing just that.\n",

    "`simple_test` runs the pathfinding algorithm on a single, straightforward instance, while `massive_test` executes it on a series of more involved instances. Both tests operate under the assumption that the search function follows the pattern below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "search(task_map, start.i, start.j, goal.i, goal.j, *optional arguments*) -> (path_found, last_state, steps, search_tree_size, open, closed)\n",

    "These automated tests anticipate that the search function, which is passed as an input, adheres to the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `task_map` is the grid\n",
    "- `start.i, start.j` are the  $(i, j)$ coordinates of the starting cell\n",
    "- `goal.i, goal.j` are the $(i, j)$ coordinates of the goal cell\n",
    "- `*optional arguments*` represent additional parameters of the search function, passed with *args. For instance, the heuristic function.\n",
    "- `path_found` is `True` if a path was found and `False` otherwise\n",
    "- `last_state` denotes the last state of the path. It returns `None` if a path was not found\n",
    "- `steps` provides the number of search steps taken\n",
    "- `search_tree_size` represents the number of nodes that make up the search tree at the final iteration of the algorithm, which equates to the size of the resultant search tree.\n",
    "- `open` is an iterable collection of the nodes that form the search frontier (OPEN nodes)\n",
    "- `closed` is an iterable collection of the expanded nodes (CLOSED)\n"
